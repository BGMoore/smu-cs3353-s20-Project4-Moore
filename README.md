Final Project Code for Spring 2020 Fundamentals of Algorithms

Welcome! Here is the code for my final Algorithms project on graph coloring.  It includes a main to time and start the functions, and a graph class which includes the coloring algorithms.

This project used two approaches, a randomized approach and a greedy approach.  Running the karate data set (the larger of the two), we are clearly able to see that greedy not only used less colors, but ran much faster, and I predict the difference between them would grow as the data sets grew larger.

Of course my Google Form included the link to my video talking about the algorithms, but I also wanted to include it here:

That will show you a glimpse of the code, as well as how the greedy approach is applied to the graphs.  The sample graph is the same one that can be found in search.txt

Thanks for checking out the repo and happy coloring!
